# Facial Recognition in AR

## What I attempted to build
I attempted to build an AR iOS app that can recognize a person's face and project a mesh texture onto their face in AR

## What I learned
I learned that there are always going to be multiple ways to accomplish the same goal, and it is going to be difficult to figure out which one best fits your skillset.
Also many tutorials are out of date, so be prepared to have to work on your feet and trying to figure out how to adapt an old tutorial to fit current software.

## What didn't work
As I said previously, tutorials are outdated and oftentimes an out of date tutorial combined with my lack of knowledge of a certain type of software made it extremely difficult for me to get anything done. In general I think I should have tried to do something I was at least a little bit more familiar with instead of jumping into the deep end with software that I really don't know at all.
